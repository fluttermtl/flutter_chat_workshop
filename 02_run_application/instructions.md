# Step 2: Run application

On this step, we will cover how to initialize an app. 
Complete the code to run the `SomeApp` widget.

---

## runApp

The `runApp` function is used to initialize the app.
This function is called in a main function that will be the entry point of the app.
It takes as input a widget that will be the root of the app.
Don't forget to import the `package:flutter/material.dart` that contains the `runApp` function.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
