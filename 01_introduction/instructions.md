# Step 1: Introduction

During this session, you will learn how to create a Flutter Chat app using Firebase. This link will stay the same after the workshop and will be available to be reused anytime.

The only requirement for the workshop is an internet browser. You'll write the code and run it on the right panel of this DartPad Workshop.

Within each step, you must complete the `TODO` comments.
